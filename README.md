# Memory Game Project

This is an assignment for the Udacity Front-end Basics Nanodegree, a memory game done using the HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
I used the base code provided by Udacity for the HTML/CSS and made my own JavaScript.
This project uses the Font Awesome Toolkit and the Coda webfont from Google Fonts.
